# Solutioning Thought Process

Below are the factors considered for the development of this document

## What factors do you consider?
Below are the factors considered during design of this activity
- **Audience profile** <br> The developer community roughly consists of 30% developers who would identify themselves as Javascript newbies (< 1yr experience), 50% who would identify themselves as intermediate (1 to 3 yrs), and the remaining as experts. <br> It would help develop user perception. This would help in understanding the type of background they come from and questions they might come up with.
- **User personas per profile** <br> Create a specific user profile per user type, this would help narrating the content better from the consumer perspective. The ask from the document for a integration developer would be completely different than that of the program manager.
- **Technical knowhow** <br> Based on the specific details recieved, the type of queries and the questions would vary based on the expertise of individuals. The content need to be crisp and inclusive enough to cover all.
