# Assignment case study

Your task is to ensure developers are both excited and enabled to get started, writing their apps using Async/Await. The developer community roughly consists of 30% developers who would identify themselves as Javascript newbies (< 1yr experience), 50% who would identify themselves as intermediate (1 to 3 yrs), and the remaining as experts. 

- What factors do you consider?
- What do you believe is needed for maximum impact?
- How do you track success for your work?
- What will you cover within your published content?
- What will you ignore?
- Where will you lean on external material, versus writing something from scratch?
- How do you anticipate common challenges anyone runs into?

We would like you to present your thinking process and the written content that you prepare for the same in a brief discussion (45min) with our team. We respect that you might be pressed for time, so we leave the choice to you in terms of how deep the content you prepare is. We are happy to review an outline, an early draft or a full-fledged document. The idea is to get a good picture of how you appreciate the challenge and how you approach to solve it.
