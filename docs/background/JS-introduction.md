# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language. It is the programming language of the Web. It is easy to learn.

JavaScript was invented by **Brendan Eich** in 1995, and became an **ECMA** standard in 1997. ECMAScript is the official name of the language. ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6. Since **2016** new versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016 / 2017 / 2018).


## New Features in ECMAScript 2017

The new features that are introduced in ECMAScript 2017:

- **JavaScript String padding** - ECMAScript 2017 added two String methods: padStart and padEnd to support padding at the beginning and at the end of a string.

- **JavaScript Object.entries** - ECMAScript 2017 adds a new Object.entries method to objects. The Object.entries() method returns an array of the key/value pairs in an object
- **JavaScript Object.values** - Object.values are similar to Object.entries, but returns a single dimension array of the object values
- **JavaScript async functions** - Async/Await is the extension of promises which we get as a support in the language.
- **JavaScript shared memory**
